In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with deeply nested data fetching.  Imagine a scenario where you're fetching data from multiple APIs, with each API call dependent on the result of a previous call. If one of these nested calls throws an error, it might not be properly handled or propagated up to the main component, leading to silent failures or unexpected behavior. The error might manifest as a missing data piece, incomplete rendering, or a seemingly random crash. This is subtle because the server component's error boundary might not catch all nested exceptions within asynchronous operations.

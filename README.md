This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 related to unhandled exceptions during deeply nested asynchronous data fetching within server components.  The bug leads to silent failures where parts of the UI may not render correctly or data is missing. The solution introduces robust error handling to catch and propagate exceptions up the component tree, resulting in more reliable and predictable behavior.
